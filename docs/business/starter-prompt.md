I'm working with a Next.js boilerplate project that includes authentication, database integration, and AI capabilities. Here's what's already set up:

## Current Boilerplate Structure

- **Authentication**: Better Auth with Google OAuth integration
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL setup
- **AI Integration**: Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI integration
- **UI**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- **Current Routes**:
  - `/` - Home page with setup instructions and feature overview
  - `/dashboard` - Protected dashboard page (requires authentication)
  - `/chat` - AI chat interface (requires OpenAI API key)

## Important Context

This is a **boilerplate/starter template** - all existing pages and components are meant to be examples and should be **replaced or heavily modified** to build the actual application. Don't hesitate to:

- Override existing pages completely
- Modify or replace components
- Change the routing structure
- Update the database schema as needed
- Customize the authentication flow
- Adapt the AI integration for specific use cases

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Better Auth for authentication
- Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL
- Vercel AI SDK
- shadcn/ui components
- Lucide React icons

## What I Want to Build

Basic todo list app with the ability for users to add, remove, update, complete and view todos.

## Request

Please help me transform this boilerplate into my actual application. Feel free to modify, replace, or completely rewrite any existing code to match my project requirements. The current implementation is just a starting point - treat it as scaffolding that can be changed as needed.
